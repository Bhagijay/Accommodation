# Technical Stack
*Programming Language: PHP (or similar web development language)
*Database: MySQL Server (or similar relational database)

# User Interface (UI)
The application will utilize a user-friendly interface with the following functionalities:

# List View
 Displays all available properties with basic details (e.g., address, rent).

# Map View
Shows the location of properties on a map. Selecting a property on the list should highlight the corresponding marker on the map. Clicking a marker on the map should display a pop-up window with detailed information about that property.

# Detailed Property View

# Database Design
*The database will store user data (landlord, warden, student, web master), property details (including images), and reservation requests.

# Next Steps
1.Develop the database schema to store user and property data.
2.Implement user registration and login functionalities for different user types.
3.Develop functionalities for landlords to add, edit, and delete their property listings.
4.Implement functionalities for the warden to view, approve, and reject property listings.
5.Develop functionalities for students to browse listings, view details, and submit reservation requests.
6.Implement functionalities for the web master to manage user accounts and post informative articles.
7.Integrate the list view, map view, and detailed property view functionalities.
8.Test and debug the application thoroughly.
